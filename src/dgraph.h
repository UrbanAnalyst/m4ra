 * that vertexes linked list of edges.   The member 'target' is the edge's
 * target vertex number, whereas 'source' is the edge's source vertex number.
 * The member 'dist' is the associated edge distance.  The pointers 'nextIn'
 * and 'nextOut' are used to form a linked lists of a vertices incoming and
 * outgoing edges respectively.  Such linked lists are terminated with a null
 * pointer.

 * Each vertex object has an associated linked lists of edge objects
 * representing the outgoing and incoming edges of that vertex.  The member
 * pointers outHead and inHead points to the first edge object in the linked
 * list of outgoing, and incoming edges respectively.  Similarly, outTail and
 * inTail point to the last edge of each linked list.  The number of outgoing
 * and incoming edges are stored in outSize and inSize respectively.

/* --- Directed graph class ---
 * Vertices in the graph are stored as an array of vertex objects, pointed to
 * by the member variable 'vertices'.  Each vertex is identified by a number
 * corresponding to its index in the vertices[] array.  The member
 * nVertices is the number of vertices in the graph.
 *
 * clear()      - Remove all edges from graph.
 *
 * addNewEdge() - Adds a new edge to the edge to the graph.
 *
 * print()      - Prints a text representation of the graph to the standard
 *                output.
